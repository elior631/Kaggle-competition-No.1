# Kaggle-competition-No.1
For Machine Learning course for masterâ€™s degree, Hebrew U.

In this project we predicted the wage of an individual with several features such as gender, ethnic group, geographic residency,
education, academic degrees etc.

This analysis was performed following the important article:
Blau, F. D., & Kahn, L. M. (2017). The gender wage gap: Extent, trends, and explanations. Journal of Economic Literature, 55(3), 789-865.

We tested several models as the following: Linear Regression with Ridge regularization (using the Lambda 1.se),
Random Forest, Principal Component Analysis, Boosting and K-Nearest Neighbor.

In order to pick the best model, we performed interpretations analysis. we needed to make sure that we didn't overfit the models while 
our goal to minimize the RMSE of our prediction.

Here's the analysis: [link](https://rawcdn.githack.com/elior631/Kaggle-competition-No.1/5de8b1df73df39f000c3aa534b68deb45c61511c/Kaggle-rmd-E_Lior.html)

Enjoy!
